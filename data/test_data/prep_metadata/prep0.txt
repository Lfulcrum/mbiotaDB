(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C.

(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min.

Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC).

PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample.

Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C.

The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min.

Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

(12) that was found to be well-suited for the phylogenetic analysis of pyrosequencing reads (28). The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen).

A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate. Negative controls (both no-template and template from unused swabs) were included in all steps of the process to check for primer or sample DNA contamination. All aliquoting and diluting of primers, as well as assembly of PCRs, were done in a PCR hood in which all surfaces and pipettors had been decontaminated with DNA Away (Molecular BioProducts) and exposed to UV light for 30 min. A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer.

Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

A composite sample for pyrosequencing was prepared by pooling approximately equal amounts of PCR amplicons from each sample. The replicate PCRs for each sample were combined and cleaned with the Mobio UltraClean-htp PCR Clean-up kit (Mobio Laboratories) as directed by the manufacturer. Each sample (3 _L) was then quantified by using PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen) in 1_ Tris-EDTA (pH 8.2) in a total volume of 200 _L on black, 96-well microtiter plates on a BioTek Synergy HTP microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) using the 480/520-nm excitation and emission filter pair. Once quantified, the appropriate volume of the cleaned PCR amplicons was combined in a sterile, 50-mL polypropylene tube and precipitated on ice with sterile 5 M NaCl (0.2 M final concentration) and 2 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol for 45 min. The precipitated DNA was centrifuged at 7,800 _ g for 40 min at 4 C, and the resulting pellet was washed with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and centrifuged again at 7,800 _ g for 20 min at 4 C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 7 min at room temperature, then resuspended in 100 _L of DNA-nuclease free water. The sample was sent to the Environmental Genomics Core Facility at the University of South Carolina (Columbia) for pyrosequencing on a 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX (Roche) machine.

The forward primer (5_-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer B, the broadly conserved bacterial primer 27F, and a 2-base linker sequence (TC). The reverse primer (5_-GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGNNNNNNNNNNNNCACATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-3_) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A, the bacterial primer 338R, a CA inserted as a linker between the barcode and the rRNA primer, and a unique 12-bp error-correcting Golay barcode used to tag each PCR product (designated by NNNNNNNNNNNN; see Table S3). PCRs consisted of 0.25 _L (30 _M) of each forward and reverse primer, 3 _L of template DNA, and 22.5 _L of Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Samples were initially denatured at 94 C for 3 min, then amplified by using 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 90 s. A final extension of 10 min at 72 C was added at the end of the program to ensure complete amplification of the target region. All samples were amplified in triplicate.
